# Overview 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Domain
Email spam detection is one of the most important features for mailbox websites such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail. These platforms serve a large number of users globally, and unwanted emails can raise serious risks (i.e., phishing attacks, fraud, and malware spread), where safe communication can become compromised. Machine learning can offer a reliable solution to this problem domain as it can learn directly from historical data and identify patterns that can distinguish whether an email can (or cannot) be labeled as spam. This supervised learning approach would include using logistic regression, as it is designed for binary classification modeling (1 = True, 0 = False), where true (1) values would confirm spam, and false (0) values would detect that an email is not spam. Furthermore, using numerical features that include the frequency of words, characters, and capital letter usage can be applied to a logistic regression model to estimate the probability that a message belongs to the spam category.

# Objective
The main objective for this analysis is to apply logistic regression in order to classify emails as spam or non-spam using the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (University of California, Irvine, 1999). The main research question for this project is: “Can Logistic Regression predict the likelihood that an email is spam based on text-related features with great accuracy?” The Logistic Regression model will specifically examine how patterns such as word frequencies, capitalization behaviors, and character frequencies can influence the likelihood of a message being classified as spam. The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the model’s accuracy, interpretability, and suitability for spam classification, while also identifying which features are most predictive of spam content.
